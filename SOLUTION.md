# Solution Steps

1. 1. Define a fully normalized PostgreSQL schema using async SQLAlchemy models, separating trades, portfolios, positions, and audit events with strict foreign keys, optimized indexes, and suitable data types.

2. 2. Create models for Trade, Portfolio, PortfolioPosition, and AuditEvent using SQLAlchemy ORM, ensuring all appropriate relations, constraints, and multi-column indexes for high selectivity on common queries.

3. 3. Tune the async database connection settings in the engine (in db/database.py), using asyncpg, connection pooling, and ensure a sessionmaker for true async context usage.

4. 4. Implement the data access layer (db/crud.py) with all multi-table operations using 'async with session.begin()' for transactional safety, non-blocking async queries, and proper ACID principles.

5. 5. Ensure highly efficient audit logging with one-line async add and flush inside the current transaction; all compliance and audit events are logged with foreign keys and awaitable context.

6. 6. Optimize reporting and portfolio summary queries to use indexed columns, join relationships, and aggregate results in async fashion as demonstrated in get_portfolio_summary and get_audit_events.

7. 7. Provide an end_of_day_process async function that does grouped, index-friendly aggregation over trades and writes results as batch audit events within a single transaction.

8. 8. Add a database initialization script (db/init_db.py) to (re)create all tables using the async engine and SQLAlchemy metadata.

9. 9. Ensure all data access patterns in CRUD are non-blocking, not using blocking ORM attributes or queries, and can scale for high volume.

10. 10. Confirm ACID compliance by only committing writes in the context of async transactions (async with session.begin()).
